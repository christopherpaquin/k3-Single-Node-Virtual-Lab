# Exercise 1: Cluster Orientation

**Module:** Foundations

**Prerequisite:** K3s installed and `kubectl` working from your own user
([K3s/Headlamp Install §1](../K3S-HEADLAMP-INSTALL.md#1-installing-k3s)).

---

## Theme

Before touching any workloads, get comfortable looking at the cluster
itself.

Every exercise after this one assumes you can quickly answer three
questions on your own: *is the cluster healthy, what does it look like right
now, and where would I look if something were wrong.*

This exercise is entirely read-only — you won't create or change anything.
The goal is just to build the habit of checking, not to memorize output.

---

## What you'll do

- Confirm the K3s service itself is healthy at the systemd level.
- Confirm the Kubernetes node is healthy at the cluster level.
- Read a node's full description and understand what each section means.
- Check version information for both Kubernetes and K3s.
- Understand why this single node is also the control plane.
- Look at what namespaces exist out of the box, and why.
- See the limits of `kubectl get all -A` as a "show me everything" command.

---

## Step 1: Check the K3s service

K3s runs as a systemd service on the host. Before you ever ask Kubernetes
whether something is wrong, it's worth confirming the underlying service is
even up.

```bash
sudo systemctl status k3s --no-pager
```

Look for:

- `Active: active (running)` — the service is up.
- The `Main PID` and recent log lines below it — if K3s were crash-looping
  at the systemd level, you'd see repeated restarts here, before Kubernetes
  itself ever gets a chance to report anything.

If this command shows anything other than `active (running)`, everything
below it will fail or hang — so it's always the first thing to check, not
`kubectl`.

---

## Step 2: Confirm the node is Ready

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Expected output looks like:

```
NAME   STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
k3     Ready    control-plane,master   45m   v1.36.2+k3s1
```

The column to focus on is `STATUS`. `Ready` means the kubelet on this node
has told the control plane it's healthy and able to accept workloads.

Other values you might see later in the lab (not now): `NotReady`,
`SchedulingDisabled` (after a `cordon`), or the node missing entirely (if
K3s itself is down).

---

## Step 3: Describe the node in full

```bash
kubectl describe node
```

(With only one node, you can omit the node name — `kubectl describe node`
will use it by default. On a multi-node cluster you'd need
`kubectl describe node <name>`.)

This is a long output. Read it in sections rather than top to bottom:

**Labels** — near the top. These are how the scheduler identifies and
selects nodes. You'll use these directly in the Scheduling exercise later.

**Taints** — also near the top, often `<none>`. Taints repel pods unless
they have a matching toleration. Notice K3s does **not** taint its
control-plane node the way a full `kubeadm` cluster normally would — that's
why regular workloads can run here at all, despite this node also being the
control plane.

**Conditions** — near the middle. Look for `Ready: True`, and confirm
`MemoryPressure`, `DiskPressure`, and `PIDPressure` are all `False`. These
flip when the node is under real resource strain — worth remembering for
later when you intentionally exhaust memory in the Resource Requests and
Limits exercise.

**Capacity / Allocatable** — how much CPU and memory the node has in total
(`Capacity`), versus how much Kubernetes can actually hand out to pods
(`Allocatable`, slightly lower — some is reserved for the OS and Kubernetes'
own components).

**Non-terminated Pods** — a table near the bottom showing every pod
currently on this node and what it has requested/limited. On a single-node
cluster, this is literally every pod in the cluster.

---

## Step 4: Check versions

```bash
kubectl version
```

This prints both the **Client Version** (the `kubectl` binary you're
running) and the **Server Version** (the Kubernetes version the K3s API
server is running). They can differ slightly — that's normal and supported
within a version skew window; it's only a problem if they're far apart.

```bash
k3s --version
```

This shows the K3s-specific version string, plus the version of the bundled
Go runtime it was built with. K3s wraps a specific upstream Kubernetes
release — the `+k3s1` suffix on the version string identifies K3s's own
patch level on top of that upstream release.

---

## Step 5: Inspect CPU, memory, and role labels directly

Rather than reading the whole `describe` output again, pull specific fields
directly — this is a preview of the CLI-efficiency techniques you'll use
constantly later in the lab.

```bash
kubectl get node -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.capacity}'
echo

kubectl get node -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.allocatable}'
echo

kubectl get node --show-labels
```

In `--show-labels`, look specifically for:

- `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane=true`
- `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true` (an older, still-present alias)

Both are just labels — nothing magical distinguishes a "control-plane node"
under the hood beyond these labels plus the control-plane pods (API server,
scheduler, controller-manager) actually running on it. On this single-node
lab, everything happens to run in one place.

---

## Step 6: Review the namespaces K3s creates by default

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

You should see:

- `default` — where resources land if you don't specify a namespace.
- `kube-system` — where K3s's own components live (CoreDNS, Traefik,
  metrics-server, the local-path provisioner, and — if you completed the
  [K3s/Headlamp Install guide](../K3S-HEADLAMP-INSTALL.md) §2 — Headlamp).
- `kube-public` — readable by all users (including unauthenticated ones);
  used for cluster-wide public information. Normally empty in practice.
- `kube-node-lease` — holds a lightweight "lease" object per node, used for
  node heartbeats. Faster and cheaper than the old heartbeat mechanism of
  updating the full Node object on every check-in.

You'll create your own namespace for lab workloads in the Namespaces
exercise later.

---

## Step 7: List resources across all namespaces

```bash
kubectl get all -A
```

Right now this should show mostly `kube-system` pods, services, and
deployments — plus your own `my-headlamp` resources if you installed
Headlamp.

**Important caveat, worth internalizing now:** despite the name, `get all`
does **not** mean literally everything in the cluster. It only covers a
fixed, curated set of common resource types (Pods, Services, Deployments,
ReplicaSets, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and a few others).

It does **not** include ConfigMaps, Secrets, PersistentVolumeClaims,
Ingresses, ServiceAccounts, or Roles — all of which you'll work with
directly in later exercises. If you ever go looking for a resource with
`get all -A` and don't find it, that's very likely why — not because it
doesn't exist.

---

## Recap

In this exercise, you:

- Confirmed K3s is healthy at the systemd level, before ever touching
  `kubectl`.

- Confirmed the node is `Ready` at the Kubernetes level, and know what that
  status actually represents.

- Read a full `kubectl describe node`, and know what each section (Labels,
  Taints, Conditions, Capacity/Allocatable, Non-terminated Pods) tells you.

- Checked both the Kubernetes client/server version and the K3s-specific
  version.

- Confirmed this single node carries the control-plane role via labels, and
  understood why K3s leaves it schedulable rather than tainting it.

- Reviewed the four namespaces K3s creates automatically, and what each one
  is for.

- Learned that `kubectl get all -A` is a curated shortcut, not a literal
  "everything" command — and which common resource types it leaves out.
